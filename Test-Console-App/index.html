            Let's assume, the JS now received the data from C#:<br />
            <br />We have: <br />
            Encrypted data in C# results in a JSON string, which can be also decrypted on the JS side (and vice versa): 
            <br/>'{
            <br />"DerivationType": "scrypt",
            <br />"Salt": "14beb3414afb8a1de8604de90a05407de29a280336a7b4aee5876bda55ab137f",

            <br />}'
            <br />and the passphrase: This_is_my_password!
            <br />Please note that the C# side also has a password generator (PasswordGenerator.GenerateRandomPassword(20); for password length of 20 characters, you can define the character set)

    <h1>Test for binary decryption with JS of C# encrypted file</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Please load the file "cartman.enc" with the File dialog button.</strong>
        This is a test of the "cartman.enc" file, which was encrypted with C#, will be correctly decrypted by JS.
        To decrypt correctly, JS not only needs the password, but also the settings (for SALT, IV, etc), which
        can be passed with a JSON: var jsonBinarySetting =
        {"DerivationType":"scrypt","Salt":"36fa904885f19e78152aa73366c40cc6df86aa2de20dbc5072aee7a912bdf142","Cost":16384,"BlockSize":8,"Parallel":1,"KeySizeInBytes":32,"DerivationIterations":0,"AesRijndaelIv":"FWhL0yPPay662/9IoE0ICw==","CipherOutputText":null};
        <br /><br />
        <p>Load file "cartman.enc" with button:</p>
        <input type="file" id="fileOpen" />
        <div id="result"></div>
        <div id="information">Information: </div>

        <h1>Test for hashing with Scrypt</h1>
        <p>
            There is also an implementation for Scrypt. Scrypt is a new(er) way to hash passwords more securely, if
            <br />you want to store them in your database, etc. Scrypt takes longer to hash - you can set it according
            <br />to hardware performance. I. e. you can define that hashing a password takes a second on a fast machine.
            <br />The purpose of that is to make brute force (and dictionary) attacks considerably harder for attackers.
            <br />
            You can run Scrypt asynchronously and get a progress (plus you can cancel) by passing a callback function.
            Scrypt will pass the hash key to that callback function. If you omit the callback function, then Scrypt runs
            synchronously and returns the key. So either, you run sH.Hash(password, options, callback);
            or you run var key = sH.Hash(password, options);

        <h1>Test for binary decryption with JS of a file, which is in an uncompressed ZIP and is AES encrypted (ZIP AES encryption)</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Please load the file "./zip-test-data/test.zip" with the File dialog button.</strong>
            This is a test of the "test.zip" file, where an image is included, which was encrypted with the standard ZIP AES. The image  was not ZIP compressed (compression = store).
            <br />The offset and length of the to extract the image are offset: 1264, end: 146929 (length = 146929 - 1264 + 1 = 145666).
