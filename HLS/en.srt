<i>Sometimes, the reality you're facing
seems unrealistic.</i>

00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:31,561

00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,605

covered in white</i>

<i>METAPHORS OF DAWN</i>
YU HYEON-U EXHIBITION

7
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,675
<i>It's the same when you're in love.</i>

8
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:09,724
<i>It feels like you've become
the most special person in the world.</i>

9
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,018
<i>It feels unrealistic.</i>

10
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:25,239
<i>Your heart…</i>

11
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,366
<i>flutters.</i>

12
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:49,555
It's so erotic.

13
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:50,973
I know.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF A LOVER

<i>NABI</i>
YU HYEON-U

16
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:15,539
But why is it called "Nabi"?

17
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:17,333
I don't know.

18
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,876
Let's go.

19
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,462
-What should we see next?
-Let's check this out.

20
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:22,797
This one?

21
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,715
-Have you heard of him?
-Of course.

22
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,883
Na-bi.

23
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:44,902
Isn't it pretty?

24
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:07,716
Na-bi.

25
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:09,385
Yu Na-bi!

26
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:11,887
<i>What is love?</i>

27
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,353
<i>He was a serious person.</i>

28
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:20,438
What is love?

29
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:23,899
Constantly giving meaning…

30
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,862
to something abstract and unfamiliar.

31
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:29,613
Wouldn't that be true love?

32
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,752
-I knew it.
-What?

33
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:44,378
I asked to have pizza today

34
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,631
because I wanted to get a glimpse
of your feelings

35
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:49,467
through the act of sharing food.

36
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,178
-My feelings?
-Yes.

37
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:54,430
Your feelings for me.

38
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:00,311
Whether or not this one layer comes
between us tonight

39
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:02,938
will confirm
the sincerity of our relationship.

40
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:06,484
<i>Almost always…</i>

41
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,444
<i>No.</i>

42
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:10,821
<i>He was always…</i>

43
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,450
Honestly, this is ridiculous.

44
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,826
What do you mean?

45
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:20,623
I wish you wouldn't make
such arbitrary decisions.

46
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:23,542
Do my nails look that strange?

47
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,085
Everyone said they were pretty.

48
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,925
"Everyone"? If I were you,
I would've asked for my opinion first.

49
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,635
I guess I'm nothing

50
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:34,887
but a mere stranger to you.

51
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:37,681
Am I the only one who's serious?

52
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:41,268
<i>He obsessively put meaning into everything
and made endless metaphors.</i>

53
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,523
Was my work embarrassing to you?

54
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:47,983
Is that why you're crying?

55
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,153
Na-bi. Don't just look at the exterior.

56
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:53,489
You have to look at the meaning
hidden inside it.

57
00:04:55,866 --> 00:05:00,204
You could've asked me about it first.

58
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:03,165
Darn it!

59
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,793
You're making me really upset.

60
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,212
I thought you would understand me
the best.

61
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,843
<i>I once believed that it was special.</i>

62
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:17,972
I'm not sure if I'd like that!

63
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:18,931
It's a bit strange.

64
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,933
He said it's because he loves you.

65
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,561
Artists don't use just any model,
you know.

66
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:25,854
I think

67
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:28,190
he must really care about you.

68
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:29,817
You're like his muse.

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,528
-No, this is really weird.
-His muse?

70
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:33,696
This is art.

71
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,822
You call this art?

72
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,198
It looks fine.

73
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,416
<i>I was confused…</i>

74
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,960
<i>about boundaries.</i>

75
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:53,841
Excuse me.

76
00:05:56,594 --> 00:06:01,348
Your boyfriend's name
is Yu Hyeon-u, right?

77
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,268
Yes. Why?

78
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:07,271
I'm not sure if I should tell you, but…

79
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,733
My friend attends that academy.

80
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:20,492
<i>It's already been a while.</i>

81
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,505
<i>I realized the truth…</i>

82
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,217
<i>at an unexpected moment.</i>

83
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,571
<i>And to be honest,
I felt like I already knew it.</i>

84
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:09,667
<i>But…</i>

85
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:13,837
Na-bi.

86
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,887
I'm swamped with the academy
and the exhibition.

87
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:24,682
If the exhibition's successful,
I'll quit being a teacher

88
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,392
and focus on my art career.

89
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:29,561
But I'm not sure what theme I should do.

90
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:33,857
Mr. Baek wants to express people
in their 20s as lively and free…

91
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:36,777
<i>But this jerk talked too much
for me to just blame myself.</i>

92
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:45,911
Na-bi.

93
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:49,623
Why are you sitting like that?
I'm talking about something serious.

94
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,004
You asshole.

95
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,466
What?

96
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,138
<i>Love.</i>

97
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,474
<i>It gets trampled on</i>

98
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:09,977
<i>and helplessly melts away.</i>

99
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,187
<i>It's nothing.</i>

100
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:16,525
<i>My relationship ended like that too.</i>

101
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,453
-Na-bi, where are you going?
-The studio.

102
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,537
Okay, see you later.

103
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,872
See you.

104
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:32,791
-What are you doing?
-Just chilling.

105
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,834
Hurry back.

106
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:46,013
Aren't you going to the studio?

107
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,556
-Go ahead first.
-Go ahead first.

108
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,707
-Hi.
-Hey.

109
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,467
Hi.

110
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,760
Hi.

111
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:27,387
Hi, Na-bi.

112
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,312
Where were you, Na-bi?

113
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:36,772
Just outside.

114
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:38,482
Na-bi, help me.

115
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:39,942
You should do it yourself.

116
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,152
Na-bi, can't you concentrate
for a few hours?

117
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:55,165
Jeez, what a jerk.

118
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,668
What is it this time?

119
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,838
He's the one who suggested
going to a hotel instead of a motel.

120
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:02,464
And now he wants me to chip in.

121
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:04,633
Who? The guy you met
through the app yesterday?

122
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:05,592
Yes!

123
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,636
I wouldn't feel this upset if he was good.

124
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,347
It wasn't even worth spending
a night with him!

125
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,142
-Why'd you sleep with him, then?
-He must've been handsome.

126
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,601
She loves handsome guys.

127
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,521
This is so annoying. Let's go for a smoke.

128
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:21,733
No, I'm quitting for a while.
I'm not going to smoke for three days.

129
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,569
What's in three days?

130
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:24,987
A blind date.

131
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,031
I'll quit until then,
and if it's bearable, I'll keep it up.

132
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,617
-Another blind date?
-You're unbelievable.

133
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,327
Do you like men that much?

134
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:33,912
You're one to ask.

135
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:35,122
Point taken.

136
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,373
It's too noisy here.

137
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,001
-You're going to work, right?
-Yes.

138
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,380
-You're really not going?
-Bye.

139
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:46,216
Then who can I smoke with?

140
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,635
What if I get kidnapped
while smoking alone?

141
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,138
-I wonder if my mother would cry for--
-I'll come with you.

142
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:53,223
You're the best.

143
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,559
I just got here.

144
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,772
-All right, I'm coming.
-Just a little more.

145
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:03,108
Do you climb up all these stairs
every time you smoke?

146
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:05,402
-I don't mind if it's for a drag.
-Gosh.

147
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:08,947
If he's okay, swipe right.
If not, swipe left.

148
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:12,242
And if you both swipe right
for each other, it's a match.

149
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:14,286
And then?

150
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,496
Then you message back and forth here.

151
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,374
If it goes well, you exchange numbers
and maybe meet up later.

152
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:21,835
I guess today is not the day.

153
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,379
But nobody uses
their real names here, right?

154
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:26,757
Right. I don't show my face
on my profile, either.

155
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,427
But some people just reveal
their names and faces.

156
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,179
Oh, I hate tattoos like this!

157
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:33,347
Tattoos?

158
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:38,101
The guy I met yesterday
had a huge tattoo, too.

159
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,353
You know what it said?

160
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:45,943
His thing kept dying,
and he says "never die"?

161
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:47,694
-How--
-Keep it down.

162
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:49,112
It was so ridiculous.

163
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,948
Some tattoos are pretty, though.

164
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,701
Like whose?

165
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,036
What?

166
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,206
Are you seeing someone?

167
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,293
What are you on about?

168
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,295
As if I would.

169
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,428
Do you want to join us for drinks later?

170
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:16,014
No, I'm fine.
I'm going to work late today.

171
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:17,140
Again?

172
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,686
-Life must be so boring for you.
-Whatever.

173
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:26,942
Look. He's one of our juniors.

174
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,486
He said he wants to drink with you.

175
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:30,862
When will I finish?

176
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:34,199
I stayed up all night.
I'm going to have to stay up again.

177
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:37,494
I just got out of a relationship,
remember?

178
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:38,912
Hey, I didn't mean that.

179
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,831
We all know each other except for you.

180
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:42,874
So I just wanted to introduce you two.

181
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:46,294
Well, anyway…

182
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:47,838
God, you're so boring.

183
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,591
Oh, no! I accidentally swiped left

184
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:54,177
-on a total hottie!
-Let me see.

185
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:56,263
I can never see him again.

186
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:02,352
You're acting unlike yourself today.

187
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,188
What? What is it this time?

188
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:08,734
Oh, well. You got rid of that jerk,
so you should move on.

189
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,279
-But this app isn't for you.
-Why not?

190
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,740
You're pretty
but you have no taste in men.

191
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:16,658
-You'll only attract losers.
-Hey!

192
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:17,784
What?

193
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:20,871
Well…

194
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,499
Maybe.

195
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,254
-You're really not coming?
-No.

196
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:30,505
Have fun.

197
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,258
You're so boring.

198
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,218
Call me later!

199
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:36,261
Okay.

200
00:13:55,572 --> 00:14:01,995
EPISODE 1: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FATE.
NEVERTHELESS,

201
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,881
THE DAY SHE BROKE UP WITH X

202
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:39,991
You got here first.

203
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:54,339
Who are you?

204
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,300
Aren't you So-ri?

205
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:03,014
No, my name is Yu Na-bi.

206
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:04,975
Na-bi?

207
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:13,567
I guess I mistook you for someone else.
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,318
It's fine.

209
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:18,864
<i>It's silly, but the moment our eyes met…</i>

210
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:41,887
<i>The pain of the breakup</i>

211
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:45,056
<i>that had been weighing down on me
just a minute ago…</i>

212
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,103
Can I sit here?

213
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,065
You're already sitting there.

214
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:00,322
Are you with someone?

215
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,326
No, I'm not.

216
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,495
<i>…melted away like snow.</i>

217
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:11,500
But aren't you here to meet someone?

218
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,669
You said you mistook me for someone else.

219
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:16,630
I canceled on her.

220
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:18,632
Why?

221
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:21,259
I just thought…

222
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,390
I didn't need to meet her.

223
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,111
The loser grants the winner a wish.

224
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:41,238
Remember?

225
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,406
I've been conned.

226
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:45,492
Keep going.

227
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:48,620
So you broke up today?

228
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:49,579
Oh.

229
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:51,998
Yes.

230
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,125
I flat out dumped him.

231
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,128
I guess he was a bad guy.

232
00:16:57,796 --> 00:16:58,713
Well…

233
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,091
he was a total joke.

234
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,343
I was an idiot for dating him.

235
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:06,555
Good riddance. Now nothing holds me back
from leaving the country.

236
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,598
-For travel?
-Exchange student.

237
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,851
I want to go to Paris.

238
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,812
That's cool.

239
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:17,357
But it won't happen anytime soon.
Do you like traveling?

240
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,150
I've never traveled properly before.

241
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,528
-I want to go at the end of the year.
-With who?

242
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:27,409
Alone?

243
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:30,745
With a friend? Or…

244
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:32,581
your girlfriend?

245
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,750
I'm not sure.

246
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,836
With anyone.

247
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:46,678
Here you go.

248
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,597
It's my turn now, right?

249
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,441
Why is it so hard?

250
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,985
Because you haven't done it often.

251
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,780
If you keep practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

252
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,909
It doesn't matter where it hits.

253
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:15,707
Just try to get it near the red dot.

254
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:18,668
Easy.

255
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:29,512
That's unexpected.

256
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:33,266
What do you mean?

257
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,562
You look a bit different when you smile.

258
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,985
What are you talking about?

259
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:46,696
Move over.

260
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:55,038
I won.

261
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,374
Of course you did.

262
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,877
You seem happy for a loser.

263
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,337
Well…

264
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,172
it was fun.

265
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:06,049
Right.

266
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,259
It's fun to be with you, Na-bi.

267
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:12,347
<i>This guy…</i>

268
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,892
<i>is bad for my heart.</i>

269
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:17,435
Okay.

270
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:20,689
Easy.

271
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:21,815
Easy.

272
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:30,657
YU JEONG-RAN

273
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:35,787
Yes, Mom.

274
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,249
<i>Na-bi.
Your aunt made your favorite side dish.</i>

275
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,543
-<i>Should I ask her to send it to you?</i>
-No…

276
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,920
I still have a lot left over
from last time.

277
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:47,549
<i>Just throw away the leftovers
and eat the new ones she sends.</i>

278
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:50,009
You always tell me to throw away stuff.

279
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:51,010
I'm hanging up now.

280
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,012
<i>Why are you in such a mood?</i>

281
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,765
<i>I want my precious daughter
to have new and good stuff.</i>

282
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,100
Anyway, it's fine.

283
00:19:58,685 --> 00:20:00,186
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

284
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:05,024
<i>It's only an hour away by subway
but you never come home.</i>

285
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,777
Because he's there…

286
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,992
I just have a lot of assignments
these days.

287
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:15,702
How is Ttoli?

288
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:19,831
<i>Ttoli is always whimpering
because she misses you.</i>

289
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:23,126
<i>Bring your boyfriend.
I'll treat you to delicious food.</i>

290
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,294
There's no boyfriend.

291
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,630
<i>What? Did you break up?</i>

292
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,259
<i>Na-bi.</i>

293
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,474
Mom, I need to hang up.

294
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,701
What?

295
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:27,816
Why were you named after a butterfly?

296
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:33,446
So my life could be sweet like honey.
My mom and aunt named me.

297
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:38,576
I'm just kidding.

298
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:43,248
Do you know Nathaniel Hawthorne?

299
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,626
He's my aunt's favorite author,

300
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,128
and he said this.

301
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:51,631
It's a bit cringey to quote it.

302
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,553
"Happiness is like a butterfly which,

303
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:01,015
when pursued, is always beyond our grasp,

304
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:05,311
but, if you will sit down quietly,
may alight upon you."

305
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,901
That's the back story.

306
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,822
It's nothing special.

307
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:16,739
No…

308
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:18,992
I love it.

309
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,179
Is that a butterfly…

310
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,265
on your neck?

311
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:43,349
Yes.

312
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:47,687
I like…

313
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:51,482
butterflies.

314
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:04,579
All done.

315
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,837
It's cute.

316
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:16,674
Is this really your wish?

317
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,719
That was pretty simple.

318
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:23,681
Then should I…

319
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,226
make another wish?

320
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:45,495
This is silly.

321
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,413
What do you mean?

322
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,957
It's nothing.

323
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:07,392
The moon is pretty today.

324
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,443
Do you want one?

325
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:21,698
It's my last one.

326
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:23,533
Well…

327
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,410
I don't smoke.

328
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,664
Excuse me.

329
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:31,290
Can I borrow a cigarette?

330
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:35,044
Gosh.

331
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:37,171
I'm sobering up.

332
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:41,384
Hey, can I borrow a cigarette?

333
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,931
If we run into each other next time,
I promise to return the favor.

334
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,727
I do have one, but…

335
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,619
What the hell?

336
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,684
What?

337
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:34,479
Why are you smiling?

338
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,873
Are you okay?

339
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:58,211
Yes.

340
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:00,046
I'm fine.

341
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,236
Do you want to go see butterflies?

342
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,322
Where would we see them?

343
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:29,575
At my place.

344
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,127
Let me go to the bathroom for a minute.

345
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:52,640
What are you doing?

346
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:55,768
I miss you too.

347
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,479
Are you going to sleep?

348
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:04,151
Yes.

349
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:09,448
<i>What? So you just left?</i>

350
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,784
Did you contact him after that?

351
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:13,119
Of course not.

352
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:16,914
I told him about where my name came from,
but I don't even know his name.

353
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:19,333
You mustered up your courage, though.
Too bad.

354
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,546
What's that?

355
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,549
Oh, this?

356
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:27,717
Well…

357
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:29,594
It's nothing.

358
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:30,803
It's love.

359
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:34,348
It's nothing like that.

360
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,017
-Then what is it?
-Lust?

361
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,894
I don't know. It's just…

362
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,479
It was fun.

363
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:45,192
It's hard to find someone
you feel an instant connection with.

364
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:47,445
Never mind that.
You said he has a girlfriend.

365
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:50,740
You should never hang out with cheaters.

366
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,578
Oh, right.
I have to post the part-time job ad.

367
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:57,371
Or should I ask some of the kids?

368
00:27:57,455 --> 00:27:58,664
All right.

369
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,000
How about Jae-eon?

370
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,336
I'm not sure. Would he do it?

371
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,589
I'll try to convince him.

372
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,260
Hello.

373
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:13,387
Oh, do, re, mi, fa, sol. Sol is here.

374
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:17,058
I have a meeting with the professor.

375
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:19,185
Right. Go inside with Na-bi.

376
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:25,566
-Together?
-Together?

377
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,611
It's okay. Sol can have the meeting first.

378
00:28:28,694 --> 00:28:30,363
It'll be a waste of time.

379
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:32,198
It's about
the exchange student program, right?

380
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:36,369
The professor's nagging will get longer
if it's one-on-one.

381
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:37,495
Right.

382
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:39,497
Right.

383
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:41,332
Bye, then.

384
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,375
Bye.

385
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,046
You're really clueless, aren't you?

386
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:48,756
What do you mean?

387
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,718
Na-bi was feeling uncomfortable since
she didn't want to be compared to Sol.

388
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:54,136
Is that so?

389
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:57,306
You only picked hard places to get in.

390
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:01,686
Na-bi, it'll be difficult to get
accepted to any of these schools.

391
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:02,895
You know that, right?

392
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:06,649
Yes.

393
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:07,984
I'm not saying you're bad.

394
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:09,652
You're doing well,

395
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,405
but there are only
a limited number of spots.

396
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:15,283
You have to raise your GPA.

397
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,826
Work harder, okay?

398
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:19,078
Yes, ma'am.

399
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:22,540
And going abroad isn't always
the best answer.

400
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:24,834
Staying in Korea could be a better option.

401
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,920
Domestic graduate schools
are pretty good too.

402
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:30,840
There's no place like Korea for Koreans,

403
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:31,966
don't you think?

404
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,177
Right.

405
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:37,596
Let's talk again next time, then.

406
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:40,057
What about you, Sol?

407
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:42,059
You didn't submit your list?

408
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:44,270
No, not yet.

409
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:46,897
You could start next semester.
What are you waiting for?

410
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:48,941
Is there something going on?

411
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,445
No.

412
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,406
I'll make my decision soon, ma'am.

413
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:59,243
All right.
I'd prefer it if you made it quick.

414
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,120
It's a waste of time.

415
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:03,873
You might think it won't be any different.

416
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:07,126
But there are things you can learn
from the world out there.

417
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:09,545
This is a great list.

418
00:30:10,212 --> 00:30:13,299
Take a look at this,
and make your decision.

419
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,927
LIST OF PROSPECTIVE UNIVERSITIES

420
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:17,970
Yes, ma'am.

421
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:22,975
Why do you two look so gloomy?

422
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:25,186
You should be shining at that age.

423
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:26,896
Don't stay holed up in the studio.

424
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,357
You should make your life eventful

425
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,610
to get inspiration for your work.
Got that?

426
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:34,653
Yes.

427
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:36,864
Yes.

428
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:44,038
I think she said the word "inspiration"
over 100 times.

429
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:48,334
Just take it.

430
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,961
I was about to give you the file
if you needed it anyway.

431
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:53,381
Thanks. It'll be helpful.

432
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,509
It was so embarrassing, though.

433
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:58,135
What was?

434
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:02,056
I listed up all the great universities
without thinking about my grades.

435
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:05,434
I'm jealous, Sol.
You can go pretty much anywhere.

436
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,606
It might not be the best idea
to go abroad.

437
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:15,236
Honestly, it kind of feels like
I'm just trying to run away.

438
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:17,279
Were you thinking that too?

439
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:19,115
Yun Sol!

440
00:31:22,118 --> 00:31:23,661
Oh, you were with Na-bi.

441
00:31:23,744 --> 00:31:26,330
What did the professor say?
Why did she call you two?

442
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:27,623
It was for the exchange--

443
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:30,084
Just talking about assignment ideas.

444
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,293
Assignment ideas?

445
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:34,880
Why did she leave me out?
This is favoritism.

446
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:36,757
She just gave us a bit of advice.

447
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:38,717
We'll be off.

448
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:41,220
Oh, okay. Bye.

449
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:42,263
Bye, Na-bi.

450
00:31:43,764 --> 00:31:46,892
I'm the one who's out of ideas.

451
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:57,736
Why are you dressed so nicely?

452
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,072
Do I look nice? That's a relief.

453
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:02,867
Is it because we're gathering today?

454
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,160
Well…

455
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:06,704
my blind date was supposed to be tomorrow,

456
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:09,415
but he said something urgent came up

457
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:11,208
and asked if we could meet today.

458
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,169
Otherwise, it'll be a while later.

459
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:16,130
You know how you shouldn't
put off a blind date for too long.

460
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:18,132
So I just agreed to meet him today.

461
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:20,885
What? Then what about our gathering today?

462
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:22,386
Tell the others for me.

463
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,431
Hey, I didn't want to go.
You're the one who made a fuss.

464
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:27,683
I know. I'm really sorry.

465
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,768
But if you don't go either,

466
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:33,189
everyone will curse me to death. Please?

467
00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:34,857
-Sol, please.
-Gosh.

468
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,150
All right.

469
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,067
I love you!

470
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:40,237
If things go well with my date,
I'll set you up with someone too.

471
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:41,280
There's no need.

472
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:42,698
Oh, come on.

473
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,485
-Hi. What brings you here?
-Hello.

474
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

475
00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:24,031
-Keep working.
-Okay.

476
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,661
I already chiseled it off.

477
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,831
<i>You have to raise your GPA.</i>

478
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:29,138
So you're really going to stay up working?

479
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,556
Yes.

480
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,517
Or I might not be able to finish on time.

481
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:34,977
My progress is slow.

482
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,438
Alcohol is the best when you're stuck.

483
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,648
I'm going to go drink with the kids.

484
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,818
You don't know any of our juniors.

485
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:45,112
Don't you need an assistant
for the exhibit?

486
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:50,367
At this rate, you'll be the first one
in our department to do everything alone.

487
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:57,124
Gosh. Never mind.

488
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,376
There's no way
you'll get a new boyfriend like that.

489
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,628
Bye.

490
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:05,132
Call me if you change your mind.

491
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:07,259
Okay.

492
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:09,845
Have fun!

493
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:11,013
I will!

494
00:35:56,975 --> 00:35:58,686
That will be 14,000 won.

495
00:35:58,769 --> 00:35:59,770
Here.

496
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:08,821
<i>It's him.</i>

497
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:11,281
Hang on.

498
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:25,504
<i>The library, and now this.</i>

499
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,882
<i>I must be losing my mind.</i>

500
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:35,764
<i>You're really not coming?</i>

501
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,648
Bit-na, where's the location?

502
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,669
We meet again.

503
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:12,551
What are you doing here?

504
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:17,639
Hey, you're here.

505
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:20,267
-Hi. I'm heading in first.
-Okay.

506
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,107
He's the junior…

507
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,735
who was hoping to drink with you.

508
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:34,823
I see.

509
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,367
Look! You're screwed.

510
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,581
Gosh, this place is flooded with seniors.

511
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:44,041
Seniors!

512
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:46,585
Are you sick of your seniors?

513
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:47,628
Not at all!

514
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,924
But we have a newbie now.

515
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:55,803
She made a rare appearance,
so be nice to her.

516
00:37:58,597 --> 00:38:01,099
This is Yu Na-bi,
and this is Park Jae-eon.

517
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:03,894
<i>Park Jae-eon…</i>

518
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:05,312
Oh, okay.

519
00:38:05,395 --> 00:38:08,398
<i>His name was Park Jae-eon.</i>

520
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:11,568
What's with the face?

521
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:14,947
Do you know each other?

522
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:18,158
No.

523
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:21,495
-It's our first time seeing each other.
-It's your first time?

524
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:22,996
They took turns taking a leave.

525
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,458
And Na-bi barely attends school events.

526
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:30,128
-That's right. She never shows up.
-But you come to all of them.

527
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:31,630
Hi.

528
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:38,470
Oh. Hi.

529
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:41,056
I just got butterflies in my stomach!

530
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,599
"Oh. Hi."

531
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:43,809
I'm getting butterflies!

532
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:46,728
I'm Park Jae-eon.
I'll just talk to you casually.

533
00:38:46,812 --> 00:38:48,272
He's the same age as us.

534
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:50,274
He was a business major at K University

535
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:52,693
but he took the entrance exam again
to major in sculpture.

536
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:53,819
I see.

537
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:56,029
I saw you before, though.

538
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:58,490
What?

539
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:05,289
Where?

540
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,916
At school.

541
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:13,922
I said I wanted to drink with you.

542
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:14,882
Right.

543
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:17,801
So you two have finally met.

544
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,470
It's nice to meet you.

545
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:23,849
It's nice to meet you too.

546
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,728
<i>I don't believe…</i>

547
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:30,230
<i>in fate or love anymore.</i>

548
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:35,110
<i>But this situation…</i>

549
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,363
<i>It's pretty unrealistic.</i>

550
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:43,368
That professor gives us
so many assignments. It's awful.

551
00:39:43,452 --> 00:39:45,370
You selected a bad course.

552
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:47,247
You took that class.
Why didn't you tell me?

553
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,666
-Ji-wan's still not answering?
-No.

554
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:53,503
She's not reading my messages.
I guess she's still with him.

555
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:56,381
She said she'd make it quick.
Things must be going well.

556
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,425
Hey, that's a given.

557
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,886
Ji-wan's popular with guys.

558
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,638
I'm so jealous.

559
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:05,807
So many guys asked for her number
at our high school festival.

560
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:09,019
But it seems like Ji-wan
likes the guy this time, too.

561
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:12,189
There's no point.
Bet she'll get sick of him within a month.

562
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:13,440
Right.

563
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:17,486
It's her biggest wish to go on a
couple's trip for a one-year anniversary.

564
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:19,655
-That's so cute.
-It's cute.

565
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:26,119
-I'll get it.
-It'll be hard to carry it all yourself.

566
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,413
No, it's fine.

567
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:29,498
Keep talking.

568
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:31,583
Right, so what happened?

569
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:32,876
He has a girlfriend.

570
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:48,684
Oh, my gosh.

571
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:53,021
I'm so sorry.

572
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:53,981
I'm okay.

573
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:55,565
Are you all right?

574
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:56,566
Yes.

575
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:58,986
I was looking at my phone.

576
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,779
I'm okay.

577
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:05,367
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!

578
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,284
Three! One!

579
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:07,369
-Two!
-Three!

580
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:10,747
Take off your hat.

581
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,333
-Hey. Here's a hair tie.
-Take it off.

582
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,002
Make a palm tree.

583
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:18,255
Go easy on me, please.

584
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:20,924
<i>Jae-eon is fun.</i>

585
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:22,801
You look pretty.

586
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:23,760
Jae-eon!

587
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:24,845
I'm sorry.

588
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:26,847
Off you go.

589
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,473
That look really suits you!

590
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:38,984
I'm really sorry, but…

591
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,569
Oh, you want a glass?

592
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:41,903
No…

593
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:44,114
If it's okay with you…

594
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,243
Could you watch me dance?

595
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:50,495
Don't cover your face!

596
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,622
-Five, six, seven, eight!
-<i>Jae-eon has a way of</i>

597
00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:55,292
<i>making naughty pranks seem rather fun.</i>

598
00:41:58,837 --> 00:42:00,047
Twist your body!

599
00:42:00,797 --> 00:42:01,965
What is that?

600
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:09,598
Come on!

601
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:12,601
This is so stupid.

602
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:14,269
Are you upset?

603
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:15,562
I guess he smiles a lot.

604
00:42:15,645 --> 00:42:17,189
-Let's play another game.
-What?

605
00:42:17,272 --> 00:42:18,440
-Let's drink.
-What?

606
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:20,942
-It's nothing.
-Come on. Drink up.

607
00:42:21,943 --> 00:42:23,445
It's mine.

608
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:25,864
Come on. Cheers!

609
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:28,283
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

610
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:30,285
Can you hand me that?

611
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:34,831
Thanks.

612
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,298
-Hey, guys. Gather round.
-What is it?

613
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:46,968
Who are the scumbags who did it
in the student council room last semester?

614
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:51,681
Then is it true that a condom was found
in the trash can?

615
00:42:51,765 --> 00:42:53,391
That's disgusting!

616
00:42:53,475 --> 00:42:54,851
The sofa…

617
00:42:57,187 --> 00:42:58,188
On the sofa?

618
00:42:58,271 --> 00:43:01,858
You better fess up. Could it have been…

619
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:08,156
Quit playing detective.
You're barking up the wrong tree.

620
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,074
What?

621
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:10,367
Do you know who it is?

622
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,035
-Who is it?
-Get off me.

623
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,370
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

624
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:14,746
Goodness.

625
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,456
Do you still not know?

626
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:18,834
It's Choi Min-u.

627
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:19,793
No way!

628
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:22,337
-His girlfriend is Jeong-a.
-Then it was her and Min-u?

629
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,006
Of course not. He was sleeping
with someone else.

630
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:28,552
He was cheating on her?

631
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:30,220
That asshole!

632
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:31,972
How could he do that to her?

633
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:33,390
I feel sorry for her.

634
00:43:33,473 --> 00:43:37,727
There are quite some pretty girls
who have poor judgment.

635
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:41,148
No wonder you're called Bit-na News.
Go, Bit-na News!

636
00:43:41,231 --> 00:43:42,232
Stop overreacting.

637
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:43,358
Let me pour you a shot.

638
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:45,652
-Oh, thank you.
-This is boring, isn't it?

639
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:46,862
-Is your source reliable?
-Should we leave?

640
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:49,156
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Stay out of it.

641
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:51,032
-More drinks!
-Whose glass is empty?

642
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:53,076
-Me!
-You should take a break.

643
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,452
-Here you go.
-Thank you, my dear.

644
00:43:54,536 --> 00:43:56,413
-You're the best.
-So how did you find out?

645
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:59,291
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

646
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:00,959
You dropped this.

647
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,211
Oh. Thank you.

648
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:08,049
Look at him.

649
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:15,223
You look a bit different when you smile.

650
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:24,065
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit.

651
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:25,066
Okay.

652
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:39,456
Why do I feel so annoyed?

653
00:44:44,836 --> 00:44:47,339
I should just get back to work.

654
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,478
I'm going to go buy ice cream.

655
00:45:02,145 --> 00:45:03,563
Do you want to come with me?

656
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:12,614
What do you want?

657
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:15,492
That one?

658
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:16,618
No.

659
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:18,870
Then…

660
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:20,538
what about that one?

661
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:24,084
No.

662
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:26,711
This one.

663
00:45:33,593 --> 00:45:34,636
Why did you laugh?

664
00:45:38,223 --> 00:45:39,474
Because you're cute.

665
00:45:42,352 --> 00:45:43,353
Shut up.

666
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:49,943
Your style looks different.

667
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:53,613
Hey, what are you doing?

668
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:55,532
Let's skip study hall and go play games.

669
00:45:57,033 --> 00:45:58,076
Sorry!

670
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:04,541
Why did you say you didn't know me?

671
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:07,627
Well…

672
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:11,172
I was caught off-guard.

673
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,761
It would've been strange to say
that I knew you.

674
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:19,889
I didn't know your name or your age.

675
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,769
So why did you just leave that day?

676
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:31,526
I was drunk.

677
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:37,449
Anyway, the stuff I said that day…

678
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:40,285
Just forget everything.

679
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,078
What about that day?

680
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:44,164
You didn't say much.

681
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:47,125
Well…

682
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,210
Just forget about it.

683
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:52,505
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

684
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:57,052
Okay.

685
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:02,265
You didn't erase it.

686
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,686
Oh, this?

687
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:12,275
Right.

688
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:14,402
I washed it, but it wouldn't come off.

689
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:16,529
That's strange.

690
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:19,908
It was a water-based marker.

691
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:25,121
Oh, really?

692
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,416
That's strange.

693
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,423
Didn't you want to see me again?

694
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:40,220
Well…

695
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:43,598
Not much.

696
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:45,350
But I was pretty startled.

697
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:47,644
I thought I'd never see you again.

698
00:47:50,105 --> 00:47:51,231
I was glad…

699
00:47:52,941 --> 00:47:54,317
to see you again.

700
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:22,804
Why are you two coming in together?

701
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:24,973
We bought ice cream.

702
00:48:32,063 --> 00:48:34,983
Love always begins with ice cream,
you know.

703
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:37,110
Come here!

704
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:40,780
Hey! Let's go for a smoke.

705
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:41,739
Okay.

706
00:48:42,323 --> 00:48:43,449
Do you want to come?

707
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:44,534
She doesn't smoke.

708
00:48:46,536 --> 00:48:47,370
Really?

709
00:48:47,453 --> 00:48:48,997
Be careful on the way out.

710
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:03,803
Darn it…

711
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:12,770
Here. This is my number.

712
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:16,274
If you text me your bank account number
and the cost, I'll send the money.

713
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:18,234
All right. I'll keep in touch.

714
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:22,405
I'm really sorry.

715
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:23,406
It's fine.

716
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:27,118
Your head's a bit red. Are you okay?

717
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:31,581
It's okay. My head is rock-hard.

718
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,584
Are you not hurt?
I ran into you pretty hard.

719
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,211
I'm okay.

720
00:49:36,294 --> 00:49:38,171
That's a relief, then.

721
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,839
Let's go.

722
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:45,345
Why don't we just go
for another round somewhere?

723
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:47,722
Hello? Everyone here?

724
00:49:49,974 --> 00:49:51,267
Hey, let's go.

725
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:53,269
Let's do that. All right.

726
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,856
-I'm off.
-Let's go together.

727
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,608
-Let's go.
-We're leaving.

728
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:59,901
-Goodbye!
-Good night!

729
00:49:59,984 --> 00:50:01,361
Be careful on the way home.

730
00:50:03,488 --> 00:50:06,157
You seemed to have drunk a lot.
Are you all right?

731
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:08,534
Yes, I'm fine. I'm not even drunk.

732
00:50:10,078 --> 00:50:10,912
What about you?

733
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:15,833
Is that your girlfriend?

734
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:17,377
What?

735
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:20,380
I don't have a girlfriend.

736
00:50:20,463 --> 00:50:22,757
I'm taking the bus here.
Careful on the way home.

737
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:24,968
Right. Bye.

738
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,412
We meet again.

739
00:50:52,495 --> 00:50:53,705
I like…

740
00:50:56,457 --> 00:50:57,292
butterflies.

741
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,626
I was glad…

742
00:51:00,378 --> 00:51:01,713
to see you again.

743
00:51:02,964 --> 00:51:04,465
I don't have a girlfriend.

744
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:08,928
Is this fate?

745
00:51:24,193 --> 00:51:25,320
OH BIT-NA

746
00:51:25,403 --> 00:51:27,905
<i>Guys, send 20,000 won each for the drinks.</i>

747
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,785
PARK JAE-EON

748
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:18,289
Why are you awake?

749
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:21,751
Right now?

750
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:24,587
Is it okay for me to come over?

751
00:52:41,145 --> 00:52:43,648
I SENT THE MONEY
I SENT THE MONEY TOO

752
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:46,275
Is he sleeping?

753
00:52:51,406 --> 00:52:52,698
He's sleeping already?

754
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:00,665
What am I doing?

755
00:53:25,022 --> 00:53:26,524
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

756
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:29,527
Darn it. Not you.

757
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,085
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

758
00:53:53,426 --> 00:53:54,927
Hey, Sol.

759
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:56,679
Aren't you going for a smoke?

760
00:53:56,762 --> 00:53:58,431
I already did.

761
00:53:58,514 --> 00:53:59,390
I see.

762
00:54:02,477 --> 00:54:04,437
Hey, guys.
Aren't you going out for a smoke?

763
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,522
Just go. I'm totally busy right now.

764
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:07,732
Go away.

765
00:54:09,025 --> 00:54:10,234
What about you?

766
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:12,028
No. This isn't sticking.

767
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:17,158
-You're really not going?
-Just go.

768
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,085
Hi.

769
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:29,504
Hi, Na-bi.

770
00:54:31,422 --> 00:54:32,256
Hey, Na-bi.

771
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,633
Oh, hi.

772
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:40,556
What is it, Na-bi?

773
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,058
What?

774
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:44,644
It's nothing.

775
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:47,396
-I thought it was due today.
-I have to work late.

776
00:54:51,275 --> 00:54:52,235
-Na-bi.
-Hey.

777
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:53,945
-Are you looking for someone?
-No.

778
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:56,113
I'm just getting some fresh air.

779
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:03,329
Professor!

780
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:05,122
-Professor!
-Professor!

781
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:07,917
Hey, a five-year-old
would do a better job.

782
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,669
Professor!

783
00:55:09,752 --> 00:55:12,088
Professor, can you help me?

784
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:15,716
Gyeong-jun! Please!

785
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:20,638
No matter how many colors I mix,
I can't get the right color.

786
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:22,598
I won't help you
unless you call me Mr. An.

787
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:24,600
But you're our senior.

788
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:27,478
I will be so grateful
if you could help me with this.

789
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:28,646
-No.
-Mr. An!

790
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,065
See? He calls me Mr. An.

791
00:55:31,148 --> 00:55:32,900
-Gyeong-jun! Mr. An!
-I need your help.

792
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:39,865
-What should I do?
-Just apply the second layer

793
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:42,451
and coat it with primer in the end. Okay?

794
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:44,412
PARK JAE-EON

795
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,041
He's in the group chat room, though.

796
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,919
PARK JAE-EON

797
00:55:55,131 --> 00:55:56,424
Mr. An!

798
00:55:56,507 --> 00:55:57,800
What are you doing?

799
00:55:57,883 --> 00:55:59,885
-Gyeong-jun! I mean, Mr. An!
-Hello, ma'am.

800
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:01,887
-Why were you startled?
-Mr. An, please.

801
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:03,723
I'm more startled at your piece.

802
00:56:03,806 --> 00:56:05,057
Why is there no progress?

803
00:56:05,141 --> 00:56:07,351
-I can't seem to get the color right.
-Well, I…

804
00:56:07,435 --> 00:56:09,020
I'm almost done.

805
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:11,731
This shouldn't be "almost done." Okay?

806
00:56:13,983 --> 00:56:14,984
I'll work late today.

807
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:16,527
Working late isn't going to…

808
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:22,908
-Let's talk later.
-Yes, ma'am.

809
00:56:34,295 --> 00:56:35,630
-Hey, Bit-na.
-What?

810
00:56:35,713 --> 00:56:37,673
Did everyone send the money last night?

811
00:56:37,757 --> 00:56:39,383
What? Yes, everyone sent it.

812
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:40,468
Why?

813
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:41,927
I was just curious.

814
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:43,220
They all sent it.

815
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:49,810
Jae-eon gave it to me in cash right away.

816
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:53,230
Oh.

817
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:57,735
Keep going.

818
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:00,237
Focus, all right?

819
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:01,572
I am.

820
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,373
I'm so full.
My stomach's going to explode.

821
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:11,707
Mine first.

822
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:12,959
I can't breathe.

823
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:15,169
But I can still eat dessert.

824
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,796
I can totally eat cake.

825
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:17,880
I can eat cake too!

826
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:19,966
I can eat it with coffee!

827
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:22,802
We have some time left. Shall we?

828
00:57:22,885 --> 00:57:25,763
-Sure, you little foodie.
-You guys are coming too, right?

829
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:26,681
Of course.

830
00:57:27,223 --> 00:57:30,142
Your stomachs are really going to explode.

831
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:33,062
He always picks a fight
when he's going to join us anyway.

832
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:33,980
Tell me about it.

833
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:34,981
Oh, no.

834
00:57:35,064 --> 00:57:36,649
Where are my Bluetooth earphones?

835
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:40,903
I left them at the outdoor studio.

836
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,197
Someone's going to steal them for sure.

837
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:47,535
There are security cameras everywhere.
Nobody will take them.

838
00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:48,786
Right?

839
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,329
It's so far away.

840
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:52,456
-I'll just ask in our chat room.
-Wait. I'll get them.

841
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:53,958
Really?

842
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,292
Yes.

843
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:57,420
It's fine. You don't need to.

844
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,006
No, I was about to go back anyway.

845
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:02,299
I'll get them and put them in your locker.

846
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:03,592
Send me your passcode.

847
00:58:03,676 --> 00:58:05,052
I'm so touched.

848
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:06,012
Thank you.

849
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:07,388
It's nothing.

850
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:09,932
She's so kind.

851
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:12,893
What should I do?

852
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:16,022
I'm so popular.

853
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:18,607
Dream on. She'd never fall for you.

854
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:22,194
I was just saying!
Why would she do that for me?

855
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:24,905
She was going to head back anyway.

856
00:58:24,989 --> 00:58:26,657
Never mind. Let's go have some cake.

857
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:28,034
Yes!

858
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,961
What's this? Is it a bat?

859
00:58:40,087 --> 00:58:42,048
A bat? It's a butterfly.

860
00:58:43,424 --> 00:58:46,385
This piece sure feels different
from all the other ones.

861
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:47,720
Right.

862
00:58:47,803 --> 00:58:51,265
I don't even see him often at the studio.
When did he do all this?

863
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:53,142
He must be a genius.

864
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,978
Jae-eon won almost
all the competitions last year.

865
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:59,065
And he's even handsome.
Life's so unfair, isn't it?

866
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:01,901
So that was Jae-eon's.

867
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:04,153
But where did Jae-eon…

868
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,696
Oh. Hi, Na-bi.

869
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:07,406
Hi.

870
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,741
What brings you here?

871
00:59:09,366 --> 00:59:10,701
Well…

872
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:13,329
Jin-su said he left something behind.

873
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:15,414
Did you see Bluetooth earphones
lying around?

874
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:16,749
-No.
-No.

875
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:18,292
You should look around.

876
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,251
Okay, I will.

877
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:26,675
Oh, Jae-eon!

878
00:59:28,052 --> 00:59:28,886
Hey, Jae-eon.

879
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:29,929
Hey.

880
00:59:30,012 --> 00:59:30,930
Hi, Jae-eon.

881
00:59:34,725 --> 00:59:35,810
Hi.

882
00:59:36,644 --> 00:59:37,645
Hi.

883
00:59:38,437 --> 00:59:39,438
Looking for something?

884
00:59:40,564 --> 00:59:41,482
No.

885
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:46,654
Jae-eon, that's a butterfly, right?

886
00:59:46,737 --> 00:59:48,489
She said it looks like a bat.

887
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,951
You recognized it?
Everyone thinks it's a bat.

888
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:53,702
You must really like butterflies.

889
00:59:53,786 --> 00:59:56,580
-Your last piece was one too.
-Do you want to see my butterflies?

890
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:57,581
Yes. Show us.

891
00:59:57,665 --> 00:59:58,791
Yes, please.

892
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:03,838
They're so pretty.

893
01:00:05,131 --> 01:00:08,509
Is that what your tattoo is about?
Like people get tattoos of their pets?

894
01:00:13,764 --> 01:00:15,015
Do they have names?

895
01:00:16,058 --> 01:00:17,685
No, I just call them butterflies.

896
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:21,605
"Butterfly."

897
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:25,734
It's a pretty name.

898
01:00:45,713 --> 01:00:46,547
I like…

899
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,176
butterflies.

900
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:52,469
"Butterfly."

901
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:54,054
It's a pretty name.

902
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,682
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me think</i>

903
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:59,268
<i>the way my annoying ex did.</i>

904
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:02,938
It's so stupid to read too much into
meaningless stuff.

905
01:01:06,025 --> 01:01:08,527
You idiot.

906
01:01:09,236 --> 01:01:10,529
Who's an idiot?

907
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:15,201
Don't look.

908
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:18,996
Is this seaweed?

909
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:25,461
Why did you have to appear out of nowhere
and surprise me like that?

910
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:27,129
You're just insensitive.

911
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:30,716
You left without a word.
I thought you had something to say.

912
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:35,346
No, I didn't have anything…

913
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:38,766
I was just looking
for my friend's belongings.

914
01:01:42,478 --> 01:01:44,521
<i>You know how popular you are, right?</i>

915
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:49,401
<i>That's why you have that look
and talk that way.</i>

916
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:54,865
What?

917
01:01:56,033 --> 01:01:57,493
There's the seaweed.

918
01:01:58,202 --> 01:01:59,662
-Come here.
-Sorry.

919
01:01:59,745 --> 01:02:01,747
I'm sorry! Stop it.

920
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,916
-Wipe it off.
-Okay, I will.

921
01:02:03,999 --> 01:02:05,292
I'll wipe it off for you.

922
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:12,758
-Sorry! Okay, I'll really wipe it off.
-Hang on.

923
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:14,343
-You'd better.
-What?

924
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:16,220
-Come on, wipe it off.
-When did they get so close?

925
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:18,639
They look pretty good together. Hey!

926
01:02:18,722 --> 01:02:19,974
What?

927
01:02:20,057 --> 01:02:21,141
Let's just go.

928
01:02:21,225 --> 01:02:22,518
-Why?
-Come on. Let's go.

929
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,361
Why do my shoulders hurt so much?
I wish they had high bars at school.

930
01:04:02,868 --> 01:04:03,702
Relax.

931
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:07,289
Your back was hunched
when you were working.

932
01:04:07,373 --> 01:04:10,125
Hey, let go. Wait.

933
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,127
Wait. Stop.

934
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,308
I almost fell down.

935
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:40,280
Bit-na says
you practically live in the studio.

936
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:42,699
Not really.

937
01:04:43,617 --> 01:04:45,369
I like working at night,

938
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:47,746
so I often stay late. What about you?

939
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:49,665
I might try it more often.

940
01:04:50,249 --> 01:04:51,166
It was fun.

941
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:54,670
<i>As we talk,</i>

942
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:56,672
<i>I can see different sides of Jae-eon.</i>

943
01:04:59,049 --> 01:05:00,300
I envy you.

944
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,846
It used to be fun for me a long time ago.

945
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,557
It's not fun anymore?

946
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:09,977
There's a lot to think about now.

947
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:13,605
And I'm not sure what to do.

948
01:05:13,689 --> 01:05:15,357
You wanted to be an exchange student.

949
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:17,693
It seems like a good goal.

950
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:19,570
It's nothing.

951
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,575
It sounds special,
but lots of students do it.

952
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:29,580
And honestly…

953
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:35,210
I just want to go somewhere far away.

954
01:05:36,795 --> 01:05:37,629
Why?

955
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:41,049
Because of my mom and…

956
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,303
Let's stop talking about this.

957
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:45,804
It's boring.

958
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:48,724
It's not boring to me.

959
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:51,977
You're talking about your true self.

960
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:56,273
<i>He's different from
the first impression I had of him.</i>

961
01:05:57,399 --> 01:06:00,068
<i>I wanted to believe
that only I knew this side of him.</i>

962
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:10,370
There's the moon you like.

963
01:06:17,753 --> 01:06:18,754
It's pretty.

964
01:06:21,965 --> 01:06:23,050
It's pretty.

965
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:34,811
Your number.

966
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:41,693
Oh. My number?

967
01:06:45,447 --> 01:06:47,658
<i>It feels like something new
is about to begin.</i>

968
01:06:48,784 --> 01:06:50,035
<i>I'm probably not mistaken.</i>

969
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,418
Yu Na-bi. I saved your number.

970
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:02,381
<i>You know that I'm Na-bi.</i>

971
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,263
Do you want one?

972
01:07:10,138 --> 01:07:11,306
No, thanks.

973
01:07:15,394 --> 01:07:16,687
Did you get it customized?

974
01:07:17,854 --> 01:07:18,689
Yes.

975
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:20,691
Isn't it pretty?

976
01:07:22,943 --> 01:07:24,444
Another butterfly.

977
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,738
Oh, show me too.

978
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:29,825
-What?
-Your pet butterflies.

979
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:33,245
-Oh, my butterflies?
-Yes.

980
01:07:33,912 --> 01:07:35,038
Want to go see them?

981
01:07:39,418 --> 01:07:42,629
I mean, I want to see the video

982
01:07:42,713 --> 01:07:45,132
that you showed your friends. Gosh.

983
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:01,565
They're pretty.

984
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:06,820
What do you like so much about them?

985
01:08:13,577 --> 01:08:17,539
They sometimes crawl up
onto my face like this.

986
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:20,250
It feels really nice.

987
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:27,299
It's lovely.

988
01:08:32,471 --> 01:08:33,847
That tickles.

989
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,228
I want to smoke, too.

990
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,361
I don't want to go back inside.

991
01:08:52,157 --> 01:08:53,116
Me neither.

992
01:08:58,455 --> 01:08:59,831
You don't smoke, though.

993
01:09:00,707 --> 01:09:02,084
Do you want to go have drinks?

994
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,210
Drinks?

995
01:09:06,046 --> 01:09:07,881
Are you going to work some more? Then…

996
01:09:07,964 --> 01:09:10,008
No. Let's go.

997
01:09:10,926 --> 01:09:12,010
Just the two of us?

998
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:17,057
Well…

999
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,934
we can call our friends.

1000
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:21,186
Should I call them?

1001
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,729
Why are you laughing?

1002
01:09:22,813 --> 01:09:24,022
I don't know.

1003
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:26,358
You make me laugh.

1004
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:31,029
Are you that happy to drink with me?

1005
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:32,114
I am.

1006
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:45,377
<i>I'm sure…</i>

1007
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:48,505
<i>that we feel the same way.</i>

1008
01:10:45,812 --> 01:10:47,147
<i>I'm using my wish.</i>

1009
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,858
<i>I'm sure he does this to everyone.
I know everything.</i>

1010
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,486
<i>Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.</i>

1011
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:53,695
<i>So forget him.</i>

1012
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:55,363
-<i>Hey!</i>
-<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1013
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:57,908
<i>Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.</i>

1014
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:00,494
<i>Do people have to date?</i>

1015
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:03,830
<i>Why can't two people just be close?</i>

1016
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:05,123
<i>Can't they stand near each other?</i>

1017
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,542
<i>Do they have to pretend not to notice
if there's something in their hair?</i>

1018
01:11:08,251 --> 01:11:10,879
<i>What do I want from Jae-eon?</i>

1019
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:13,173
<i>You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.</i>

1020
01:11:13,256 --> 01:11:17,260
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house. Do you want to come?

1021
01:11:17,344 --> 01:11:19,554
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

1022
01:11:21,556 --> 01:11:25,018
<i>Right. I should just check for myself
and forget about him.</i>

1023
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:30,440
